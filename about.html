                    <h2>Muhammad Hashir</h2>
                    <p><strong>Web Designer & Developer | Problem Solver | Lifelong Learner</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        Assalamualaikum! I'm Muhammad Hashir, a passionate web designer and developer from Karachi, Pakistan. I love turning ideas into reality through code and design. My journey in tech started with curiosity and a drive to solve real-world problems, and today, I specialize in building modern, responsive, and user-friendly websites and web applications.
                    </p>
                    <p>I’m currently part of the team at <a href="https://nexovate-digital.vercel.app/" class="nexovate">Nexovate Digital,</a>  a growing digital agency focused on crafting next-generation web experiences. There, I collaborate with designers and developers to deliver fast, modern, and user-centric products powered by the latest frameworks and design standards.</p>
                    <p>
                        I have hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, and the Laravel framework. Whether it's crafting beautiful frontends or building robust backends, I enjoy every step of the process. My approach is always user-focused, ensuring that every project is not just functional but also visually appealing and easy to use.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I believe in continuous learning and always stay updated with the latest trends and technologies. I regularly challenge myself with coding problems, contribute to open-source, and collaborate with other developers to grow my skills.
                    </p>
